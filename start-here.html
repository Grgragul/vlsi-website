  <!-- WHAT IS VLSI -->
  <section class="card">
    <h3>What is VLSI?</h3>
    <p>
      VLSI stands for <b>Very Large Scale Integration</b>.
      It is the process of designing millions to billions of
      transistors on a single chip.
    </p>
    <p>
      VLSI engineers design digital circuits such as processors,
      memory, and controllers using hardware description languages
      like Verilog.

  <h3>VLSI FAQs – Beginners</h3>

  <details>
    <summary>What is VLSI in simple words?</summary>
    <p>
      VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) means designing and integrating
      millions or billions of transistors onto a single chip.
      It is used to build processors, memory chips, and system-on-chip (SoC) designs.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is VLSI hard for beginners?</summary>
    <p>
      VLSI is not hard if you start with the right basics.
      Learning Digital Electronics and Verilog step by step makes VLSI
      beginner-friendly and easy to understand.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What should I learn first to enter VLSI?</summary>
    <p>
      Beginners should start with Digital Electronics, then move to
      Verilog HDL, simulation, waveform analysis, and basic synthesis concepts.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need expensive software to learn VLSI?</summary>
    <p>
      No. You can learn VLSI fundamentals using free and open-source tools.
      The design flow and concepts remain the same as commercial EDA tools.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What is the difference between frontend and backend VLSI?</summary>
    <p>
      Frontend VLSI focuses on RTL design, Verilog coding, and simulation.
      Backend VLSI deals with physical design such as placement, routing,
      timing closure, and chip layout.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is VLSI good for ECE students?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. VLSI is one of the best core career paths for ECE students.
      It offers strong industry demand, long-term growth, and high learning value.
